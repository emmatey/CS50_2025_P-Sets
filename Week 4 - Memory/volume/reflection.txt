Amazingly this took nearly 2 hours. It was simple in concept, but I got triped up on a badly constructed while loop that was doing an extra iteration, I had to remember to call the funciton in the condition field of the while loop directly instead of checking the value of a var that's set after each iteration because unless I'm checking the return value within the iteration again, it will do one extra run.
